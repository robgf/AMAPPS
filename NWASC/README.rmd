What is the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog?
===
**The Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog is an aggregation of seabird count data in the Northwest Atlantic**

Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available information from seabird 
observation datasets from the Northwest Atlantic into a single database, with the 
goal of conducting research and informing coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators 
were the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program](http://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx), 
the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management](http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) 
and the [U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center](http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov). 
The resulting product is the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog (formerly the Atlantic Offshore 
Seabird Compendium), which characterizes the survey effort and bird observations 
that have been collected across space and time. As of May 2017, the database 
contains over 200 datasets from 1906-2016. While our primary objective is to aggregate seabird data, 
these data additionally include marine mammal, sea turtle, fish, bat, bug, boat, marine debris, and other incidental observations 
(see our [species codes here](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Species_Codes.rmd)). 

An archive of the scientific data is available at the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC)](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/0115356). 
The data archived at NODC is comprised of roughly 50 datasets from 1938-2013 with about 260,000 observation records. This archive is a 
subset of the main database, excluding datasets from surveys where the scientific design was not specifically 
designed to sample marine birds. These data will be archived on a yearly basis.
